wiser setup
- vagrant
- error log folder to see output of errors
- rabbitmq ssh into vagrant instruction in readme
- reprovision vagrant if you make certain changes. wsgi file for example
- pip install (for my machine and vagrant)
- upgrade instructions and below - old stuff
- vagrantfile - changed line 8 and 9 because of error
- demo@getwiser.com / getwiser
- admin login brianedelman / lightmatter
- mandril works but needs data
- delvenews old name
- erland 19
- cd /delvenews
- /var/log/gunicorn/error (for error logs) actually delvenews/log/ 

-- setup I learned
