# The Ugly TODO

# form thoughts:
* group fields should generate \_\_all__ validation rules
    * this is working now but only in a few cases. scaffolding is there at least
    * like at_least, no_more_than etc, based on their child fields and kwargs passed to them
    * when generating these rules it should grab the group's child fields and include them
* formwide submit button could be its own section composed within other layout sections e.g ["*", DEFAULT, SUBMIT]
    * could do the same with formwide provides / needs / gives too

# Alpha

## bugs
* building damage overwriting old damage?

## tech debt
* don't forget to remove django silk!!!!

## current
* inventory
* woodcutting

## UI
### mobile fiddling
* action button smaller, remove button below (I guess? maybe ask)
* smaller tilesize options
* SLOW
* some way to open sidebar easier?

### light mode is broken
* tabs

## Needs finishing
### Edge of map
* make it not break everything at least

### conflict
* set function change probably fucked everything tbh
* make yell + cower work
* allow for choices to disengage from conflict

### foraging
* add a few more events

### woodcutting
* make real

### prospecting
* make real

### onboarding
* flesh out goods and inventory setting
* finish prose
* add some version of a "quest" that you can return to and check the progress of
    * let it be hack it's fine

# POST alpha

## upgrades
### settings
* save some settings, like dark mode, to session to grab them immediately
    * can't trust any of them too much, but I guess that's nothing new
### location detail
* d3 ground?
### forms
* actually use a single handler function in FE submit response handling e.g. if the server returns a 500 show this notication in all cases
    * account for 500 vs 400
    * have a default error alert
    * are we handling __all__ resource validation in all cases
* form errors do not set validation errors correctly
    * either merge the server errors with the existing FE ones, or set correctly on BE
### text
* 'node' and 'scene' as the names of the two main context scopes is weird and unhelpful.
    * I don't remember what a scene is immediately
    * node / page?

## QUESTS
* quest model (scenario type??)
* quest marker
* all of the other shit

## conflict
* target and ability field displays
    * abilities:
        * display all of the important information like costs
    * targets
        * take another pass at top level data
        * allow for some way to see more detailed data
* skill gain -- (can be formalized more)
* ending -- (can be formalized more)
    * communicating end to parent scenario if exists



### ??
* advanced station to town onboarding adventure
    * move intro station away from town. introduction takes place in the space between them
    * pathfind between them I guess
    * maybe some baseline implementation of regions?
* ?? Quests
    * fixed to start
    * just like, build a thing in town or something


## Nice to have improvements
* Feedback on skill increases
    * flash message let me know I can now do new things (new recipes / skill unlocks)


## ideas not yet prioritized
* Towns
    * NPCs?
* dynamic map location detail
    * sights defined by skills
* Regions (roads / mountains / lakes / etc)
    * make these a thing
    * model
    * roads
        * take a path, verify it's contiguous
        * do shit like track safety, etc
    -mountains
        * pathfind out what is connected
* Sub locations
    * like caves, towns(?) or old ruins
    * real-time?
    * can be "owned" ??
* Quests
    * dynamic, based on world sim
* hidden ability settings
    * setting class created but thats all


## barely an idea yet
* pick-me-ups
* ailments
* world sim
### dynamic chat
* use game mechanics within game chat
* "pull rank" ability you can do while chatting with them. has some effect
* ability to scream or be quiet. other players may be able to hear?
