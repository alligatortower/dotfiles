# The Ugly TODO

## MVP
- translate to newer template (template keeps getting newer so no real rush)
    - at least fix the drawer
    - maybe try and make it functional for mobile?
- some kind of extremely basic new user onboarding
    - mostly done
    - finish writing it
- turns
    - completed turn log
    - queued turn log
        -mostly done just a little more info to start
- buildings
    - finalize data model / relationships
    - add action support around building them
    - drawing them to the map, or at least some kind of display
- location details
    -mostly done, just needs some data
- enough content to support a basic loop
- events now because of course there's a big new thing
- ailments


## Important post MVP
- Items
    - everything about items
- Quests
    - dynamic content. Personalized?
- make it functional in mobile if you haven't yet
- Post-turn action forms
    - are these "events"?
- refactor so consume form uses action form class
- pick-me-ups


## Want to do:
- dynamic map location detail
    - sights defined by skills


## Big ideas not yet thought through
- Sub locations
    - like caves, towns(?) or old ruins
    - real-time?
    - can be "owned" ??
