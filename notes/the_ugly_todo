# The Ugly TODO


## Nagging issues
- railrode not being generated in create_new_map flow because of off-by-one boundary error I think
    - probably want to handle getting and creating non-existing locations in a more holistic way
- actions: fix icons
- numberfield maximum 0 needs to check for !== null


## Bugs
- sign in
    - what's going on there
- ticks
    - make sure new character generation / train is working still


## conflict
- log
    - display
    - writing to log
- costs
    - how to handle displaying costs, applies to all resourceforms
        - tooltips is the best guess so far
- applying abilities
- loot
- skill gain
- ending
    - communicating end to parent scenario if exists


## Alpha
- buildings
    - finalize data model / relationships
    - add action support around building them
    - drawing them to the map, or at least some kind of display
- location details
    - make the location stats do literally anything, at least display them
    - display other characters nearby
    - display buildings correctly
- ticks
    - make them update char spirit
- enough content to support a basic loop
- ailments
    - if only just the base sickness
- ?? station to town onboarding adventure
    - move intro station away from town. introduction takes place in the space between them
    - pathfind between them I guess
    - maybe some baseline implementation of regions?
- ?? Quests
    - fixed to start
    - just like, build a thing in town or something


## Nice to have improvements
- Feedback on skill increases
    - flash message let me know I can now do new things (new recipes / skill unlocks)
- equipment
    - equiping them
    ? creating them
- redo sidebar to account for equipment and future things


## tech debt
- pathfinder
    -turn list items into objects instead of just tuples (or whatever they are now)
        - you can now serialize them easier and I bet it'll clean up that whole thing
- names
    - standardize "get_render_data" "get_json" "get_render_json" (probably the latter)


## ideas not yet prioritized
- Town
    - NPCs?
- Death
    - user-level upgrades / xp
    - class unlocking
    - user-level events to handle this?
- dynamic map location detail
    - sights defined by skills
- Regions / roads / mountains
    - make these a thing
    - model
    - roads
        - take a path, verify it's contiguous
        - do shit like track safety, etc
    -mountains
        - pathfind out what is connected
- Sub locations
    - like caves, towns(?) or old ruins
    - real-time?
    - can be "owned" ??
- Quests
    - dynamic, based on world sim


## needs more thought
- pick-me-ups
- ailments
- world sim
