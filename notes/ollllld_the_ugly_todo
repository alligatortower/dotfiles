# OLLLLLD The Ugly TODO

* don't forget to remove django silk!!!!

* !! good.current is now a float -- forms need to return invalid for non-divisible good setting

## Notables
### general
* overlay on top of the map for notable types

# POST alpha

## upgrades
### speed
### forms
* actually use a single handler function in FE submit response handling e.g. if the server returns a 500 show this notication in all cases
    * account for 500 vs 400
    * have a default error alert
    * are we handling __all__ resource validation in all cases
* form errors do not set validation errors correctly
    * either merge the server errors with the existing FE ones, or set correctly on BE

## ARE THESE STILL REAL??????
* group fields should generate `__all__` validation rules
    * when generating these rules it should grab the group's child fields and include them
* scenarios
    * event submit returns map data.
        * map may have changed, but we don't need the updated data immediately
        * consider not returning it as part of event response payload
        * also consider a more global "either return scenario or map" when fresh loading (from `upcoming/`)

## Objectives
* quest marker
* all of the other shit

* ending -- (can be formalized more)
    * communicating end to parent scenario if exists


### LOL RANDOM
* dignity
    * should be a status, idk
