REVSHOP

big tables I think I grok:
- jobs
  - parent job?
  - want a way to have a single job number for the parent
  - services might block on a job
  - need to lock the price down so future prices changes don't change the price of already completed jobs
- contacts
- organization
- event_log
- items services
  - extra things you can add to a job

tables to ask about:
*_components
 - organizations
 - press
 - paper
 -- unstructured data
*_variables
 - component???
 - contact
 - contribution
 - job
 - organization
 -- might not be relevant
pc_ocuc_org
  - seems big
  - paper data
pid
  - product id / scu
  - pid_latest
    - old math, use pid instead
  - project details? or specific item to be printed details?
RFQ
  - request for quote
  - seems similar to a job? or like a grouping of jobs maybe?
  - not happy with dynamic pricing that gets overwritten


misc questions
- capitalization in table names, meaningful?
  - job_Variables
- what's with all of the temp tables
  - tempOrgsorCid
  - tempjobvariables
  - how are these used

    - SurveyQuestionOption
    - SurveyQuestion
    - Tbldictionary
    - ValidationOption
    - Validation
  - We are modifying
    - Contact / ContactAddress -- removing address out of contact, contacts can have 0 or multiple addresses
    - JobQuantityVersion -- rolling into our concept of a project, probably

## style / small stuff
- can we name the fields (e.g.) `length` instead of `parcel_length`
- status fields being renamed to `active` wich is a bool (either true or false, defaults to true)


## Relationships
- make through table for services and paper --> orgs
  - which of these fields can be updated by an org?

## New concepts
- project
  - already exists in some form, will be a collection of jobs, services and pids for end-users
- project template
  - fast way to set up the former
- printing run
 - collection of jobs for the printers, to help improve margins

## specific table questions
- Paper
  - paper_core - what type of information is stored here

- Pid
  - pid_equipment_group -- What are equipment groups? Will you want to add more groups dynamically? do we want another table for this?
  - pid_default_paper_item_description + others -- why the square brackets in the data?
  - pid_inks_front -- only ever black or CMYK? could we do 2 bools i.e. pid_inks_front_black (true or false)?
  - pid_mandatory_services -- Do we want to link these directly to services we have in the db?
  - pid_unit_option -- will you ever want more than 3 options? We could add a PidUnitOpion model and associate however many with a pid

- contact -- none

- Organization
  - org_parent_organization -- is this reference to another org (self fk)?
  - org_organization_status -- can we change this to an org_active bool?
  - org_notes -- listed twice, just one right?
  - (sorry, typo) org_supplier_srofile_year_established
  - org_supplier_<etc> -- this is information about an org only if it's a supplier?

- Equipment
  - equip_component -- can we shorten this to just equip
  - equip_org_id / equip_org_name -- What is this used for? Is this data for specifying which org its associated with, when multiples of the same equip are listed?

- Guide Data
  - "GuideData" or "Guide"
  - gu_component_id -- fk to equipment or paper?
  - gu_effective_end/start -- do we need this?
  - hu_page_vo -- do we care about validation options? -- I think we've decided no


# New Start

Organization
  - org_parent_organization --> org_parent_organization_name

Paper
  - paper_price_uom

Services
  - service_cost, service_makeready_cost, service_markup -- all need to be floats

OrganizationPid
  - Have paper overwrite fields but not pid

JOBS -- big missing piece

statuses -- need conversation



# calculation Qs
- estimated_run_time -- which avg run time?
- number_of_bundles -- is bundle_size calculated or given by job, is there a default of 1?
- N_UP -- where is the data for this taken from?
- ink_color_sqin
- sheet_square_inches
- no. of folds?
- (obvious but want to ask anyway) job_inks_front / job_inks_back -- both job fields we need to have?
- digital cost? Is there a default value?
- example of a service associated with a job in terms of pricing engine


## meeting notes
- estimated_run_time = based on press_size_sheet
- final_height / width = flat item height / width
- bundle size default 0
- ink_color_sqin = come from press ink_color_sqin
- no of folds == hardcoded in pids
- pid has services you can add to a job created from it
- one press one paper (once created)





# SKU PRICING
- I know how to narrow down paper list, but how do I choose which one out of those to use for default paper price? Right now, as a temporary solution, I'm just taking the first of the filtered list (but the order is arbitrary currently, so "first" has no meaning).
- ditto for press / equip
- Is it correct to include the price for all mandatory services and none of the optional services?
- what are the sku fields to use for these following calculation variables:
  - job_quantity
    - need to add a field defualt at 10
  - total_plates -- which for job I'm calculating from:
    - pms_ink -- which for job I'm calculating from:
      - pms_colors_front [and is this even a valid field for jobs?]
      - pms_colors_back [and is this even a valid field for jobs?]
      - leave off for now
    - number_of_forms [and is this even a valid field for jobs?]
      - paper_list = nup has run how many of this fit on the paper


    - nup
     - default bleed to .125
     - final size (getting back to me)


    - binding_side
      - new field (landscape, portrait), default to long side


    - NEW FIELDS TO DISPLAY
      - press and paper
      - clicks
      - total_sheets
      - total_plates
      - nup
      - services
        - makeready
        - coefficient
        - others
