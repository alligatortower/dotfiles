toast game design ideas
----
amabassador can trade drinks secretly
---
option to cheers another player, mixing your drinks. If one drink is poisoned both are (nothing if niether, nothing if both already). two players can win together somehow?
---
minimum number of unique trades before you can propose a toast
----
new role: player can un-poison a drink once per game
